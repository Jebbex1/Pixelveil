# Pixelveil

A performant steganography and steganalysis library for hiding data in images, audio files, and videos!

Steganography can be used for watermarking, covert communications and info hiding in general. It is a relatively small but very versatile field in programming. This is a passion project I develop to learn, improve, and create steganography methods.
